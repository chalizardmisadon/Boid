# Boid Behaviour
Boid is an algorithm that simulates flocking behaviour developed by [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/). The complex behaviour of a flock comes from each boid following three simple rules: cohesion, alignment, separation.

This code was written based on [Chapter 6 of The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/). The simulation includes prey and predator model, and is optimized with spacial subdivision.
